# QuickStart

You have just **3** easy-peasy steps to do :)

⚠️ Using [Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com) is recommended over `npm`.

**1)** Create **CRA** app with the custom template

```shell
yarn create react-app --template cra-template-rb my-app
```

**2)** Start the example application and checkout the features made ready for you.

```shell
cd my-app
yarn start
```

**3)** When you are done examining the sample application. Clean it and start your own app!!

```shell
yarn run cleanAndSetup
```
